I'm a software technologist working on the [TileDB](https://www.tiledb.com) database. In the past, I was a research engineer building tools for surgical navigation using [MRI](https://golbylab.bwh.harvard.edu/), [mass spectrometry](https://agarlab.bwh.harvard.edu/) and other technologies. For several years, I was also heavily involved with [the Julia Language](https://julialang.org). Long ago, I ran instrument systems and supported researchers on an [ice breaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_B._Palmer_(icebreaker)) with the US Antarctic Program.

## Misc projects

- https://github.com/ihnorton/mojo-ffi -- FFI demos for the [Mojo language](https://www.modular.com/mojo), including some minor linker hackery to create shared libraries from Mojo, and link Mojo code against a C library (both unsupported within Mojo itself, when this was written).
- https://github.com/ihnorton/lldb.sh -- tiny LLDB plugin to pipe command output through a shell command (such as grep) within the LLDB repl.
- https://github.com/ihnorton/vtk-wrap-demo.jl -- Proof-of-concept project to call C++ from pure Julia, using Clang.jl to parse C++ headers and generate pure-Julia vtables (plus some macro fun).
- https://github.com/ihnorton/HackThatBase.jl -- Tool to patch new versions of Julia core library code over the prebuilt system image (long-since obsoleted, thankfully!)
- https://github.com/ihnorton/COMCall.jl -- simple COM calls in Julia, by hand.
- https://github.com/ihnorton/CSharp-Cpp-Array-Example -- Exploring C# to C(++) FFI
